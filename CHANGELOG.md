# Changelog

## 2026-03-16

### Upcoming Waves, Spore Rework, Score Screen, Heal Mage
- **Upcoming Waves panel** at top of sidebar showing next 3 waves with creep types, counts, and boss markers. Updates on wave start/clear.
- **Spore tower rework**: new `tower_aura_damage` delivery trait — damages all creeps within radius of the tower itself, not the projectile target. True area denial.
- **Score screen** replaces basic game over. Tower performance table (total damage, avg DPS, gold earned, shots, count), economy section (frontier ROI%, send investment, kill efficiency), fun stats (MVP tower, best earner), high scores.
- **Heal Mage** creep: periodic flat heal aura (15 HP/0.8s). Heal scales with difficulty toughness. Rotates into mage pool wave 18+.
- **Difficulty hints in event log**: logs modifier values at game start.
- **StatsTracker** system records per-tower-type damage/gold/shots/time throughout the game.

### Difficulty System, NoBuild Terrain, 7 New Creep Types
- **Difficulty selection** (Easy/Normal/Hard) on menu. Each creep type interprets difficulty individually — armored gets tankier not more numerous, swarms multiply aggressively, bosses get bigger shields on hard.
- **NoBuild terrain**: new cell type — creeps walk through, towers can't build. Visual X pattern. Added to all 3 maps for strategic constraint.
- **7 new creep types** (14 total): Group (burst spawn), Splitter (splits into children on death), Iron Mage (armor aura), Haste Mage (speed aura), Mist Mage (evasion aura), Evasive (25% dodge), Flying (ignores maze).
- New traits: evasion, split_on_death, armor_aura, speed_aura, evasion_aura, flat_heal_aura.
- Flying creeps use direct-line path from entry to exit, bypassing all maze walls.
- SpawnManager handles group burst spawning, flying paths, and split-on-death child spawning.

### Location-Based Projectiles, Ability Scaling, Percentage Modifiers
- **Location-based projectiles**: splash/pierce/aura towers fire at a location, not a unit. If target dies mid-flight, projectile continues to destination and still explodes. Direct damage towers still track.
- **Abilities scale with tower level**: slow duration +15%/lvl, burn DPS +20%/lvl, crit chance +3%/lvl, splash radius +10%/lvl, root chance +3%/lvl, and more.
- **Percentage-based speed modifiers**: adjacency buff and overclock use percentages instead of flat ms values.
- Faction select: removed ultimate markers (gold text, asterisks).

### Major Tower Roster Redesign, Random Faction, Creep Inspection
- **Asymmetric faction sizes**: Mechanical 8, Arcane 7, Nature 6, Void 5 towers. Trimmed towers that didn't fit faction identity.
- **Cost scaling**: 2-3 cheap starters per faction, mid-game towers, 1-2 Ultimates (600-900g). Wide cost variance instead of everything compressed in 20-70g.
- **Per-tower upgrade design**: Thorn has 5 levels, Frost has 0, Gambler has 1. Each path is unique.
- **4 Ultimate towers**: Titan Cannon (800g), Arcane Nova (700g), Elder Treant (600g), Oblivion (900g).
- **Random faction**: replaces Generic. 6 random towers from all factions each wave. Pool rotates on wave clear. Bought towers persist.
- **Creep inspection**: click any creep to see HP, armor, speed, active status effects with durations.
- **Tower tooltips**: hover over tower bar buttons for full stat breakdown.
- Hotkeys expanded to 1-8.

### Tower Expansion (28 Towers), 13 New Traits, Event Log
- Expanded all factions to 7 towers each (later rebalanced to asymmetric).
- 13 new trait handlers: crit_chance, jackpot, pierce_delivery, burn_dot, poison_dot, strip_shield, armor_shred_on_hit, damage_amp_on_hit, root_on_hit, spell_amp, overclock_buff, slow_aura, growth_scaling.
- Extended StatusEffects: burn (flat DPS), poison (% HP DPS), root (full stop), armor_shred (tier reduction), damage_amp (incoming multiplier).
- **Event log** in sidebar: wave starts, clears, tower builds/sells, sends, frontier actions, creep leaks.

### Pause Menu
- Press P for centered pause overlay with Resume and Exit to Menu buttons.

### Tower Inspect Fix, Hover Tooltips
- Fixed tower inspect mode: `enterInspectMode` calling `towerBar.deselect()` no longer triggers `enterNoneMode()`.
- Hover tooltips on tower bar buttons showing name, cost, stats, traits, upgrade count.

### Send System Improvements
- Z/X/C/V hotkeys for send types.
- Adaptive batching: 40 sends clear in ~2.5s instead of 16s.

### Frontier Grouped View
- `[v] Group` toggle: groups same-type buildings with batch action buttons.
- Fixed owned buildings visibility (container rendering order).

### Left Sidebar Layout, Selection Modes, Frontier Fixes
- 300px left sidebar: Sends on top, Frontier below, Event Log at bottom.
- 3-mode selection: Build / Inspect / None. Clicking tower bar toggles selection.
- Frontier: fixed income double-counting, wired overcharge/dig/harvest actions.
- Click-through fix: sidebar clicks don't reach the grid.

### Trait System Refactor
- Core trait architecture: composable behaviors with handler registry and resolution pipeline.
- 5-phase resolution: damage modifiers → delivery → hit effects → fire rate → updates.
- Migrated all tower/creep data to trait arrays.
- Removed all hardcoded `if (ability === ...)` chains from Tower.ts.

### Initial MVP Implementation (Phases 0-7)
- **Phase 0**: Architecture foundation — EventBus, EconomyManager, SpawnManager, InputManager, UIOverlay.
- **Phase 1**: 4 tower types (Arrow/Cannon/Sniper/Slow), 3-level upgrades, status effects, tower selection bar.
- **Phase 2**: 6 creep types, armor/damage type system, data-driven waves, 3 match modes, MenuScene.
- **Phase 3**: 4 factions with unique towers, faction abilities, FactionSelectScene.
- **Phase 4**: Fighter system — autonomous combat units per faction.
- **Phase 5**: Income system, send system, income breakdown display.
- **Phase 6**: Frontier economic side-game with faction-flavored mechanics.
- **Phase 7**: 3 maps, draft modifiers, game over screen, score tracking, pause.
